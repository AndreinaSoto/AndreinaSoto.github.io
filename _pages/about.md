I am a historian and anthropologist with professional experience in research, education, and projects for the public interest. As a **researcher** I examine the ways people of African descent contested and reshaped institutions, norms, and imperial geographies during the early modern period. As an **educator** I have taught courses on global history and Latin America using dynamic methods to help students foster their writing skills and make critical connections between the past and contemporary issues. As a **public historian**, I am passionate about making specialized information accessible to broad audiences. I have worked with different initiatives implementing **digital humanities** and **public history** methods to preserve and promote humanistic knowledge. I am part of the team behind [**Neogranadina**](https://neogranadina.org/), a non-profit organization that uses novel digital tools for the digitization, processing, and promotion of Latin America historical heritage.
