 I am a Latin American historian and anthropologist with interest in race, materiality, spatial history, and ritual practices. My current research examines the ways people of African descent used civic and religious institutions to position themselves in the colonial society, with focus on early modern Venezuela.

I am also part of [Neogranadina](https://www.neogranadina.org/), a non-profit that specializes in the digitization, processing, and promotion of archival resources from Latin America. At Neogranadina, I handle the social media outlets and the volunteers who help us in the processing of the digitized volumes.
