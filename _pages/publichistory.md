 I have worked with different organizations developing articles, educational materials, and digital resources aimed at bringing attention to the importance of historical research and archival holdings for specialized and non-specialized users. Some of the institutions I have worked in the past include the Santa Barbara Mission and Archive-Library, the Santa Barbara County Genealogical Society, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.
