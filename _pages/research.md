I specialized in the history of Latin America, with focus on the colonial period. I have research and taught topics related to political rituals, material culture, and race and ethnicity.

My dissertation examines how free and enslaved people of African descent used secular and religious institutions to navigate their social and territorial positioning in Venezuela between the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. These people managed to negotiate with the colonial authorities by organizing themselves in confraternities and militias.

I hope my research turns our attention to the ways the African descent population used legal and institutional avenues to create social networks, bring legitimacy to their communities and pursue socioeconomic benefits in a period when they had limited opportunities given their minor and dependent status in colonial society.
