I specialize in the history of Latin America and the Atlantic World during the early modern period. I have researched and taught topics related to political rituals, material culture, and race and ethnicity.

My dissertation examines how free and enslaved people of African descent used secular and religious institutions to navigate their social positioning in Venezuela between the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. I examine the ways these people managed to negotiate with the colonial authorities using different legal practices to achieve individual and collective benefits.

I hope my research turns our attention to the ways the African descent population used legal avenues to create social networks, bring legitimacy to their communities and pursue socioeconomic benefits in the Spanish Caribbean.
