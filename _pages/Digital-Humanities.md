## [Sacred Spaces. Mapping Religion and the Built Environment in Early-Modern Venezuela (Project Creator, 2019- )](https://andreinasoto.github.io/mapping-venezuela/)
  <p>Sacred Spaces is a digital project about the history of the Province of Venezuela through the lens of the religious built environment created during the colonial period (1500-1800). My goal is to create visualization tools that show how the territorial expansion of the region depended upon local actors who adapted to the circumstances of the environment and its people. I want to examine how this expansion altered the landscape and helped shape the formation of new, sometimes unstable, settlements. This project is still under development, but you can learn more about it on the official website.</p>


## [Catálogo Colectivo de Archivos Colombianos / Collective Catalogue of Colombian Archives (Project Contributor, 2019- ) ](https://ccac.neogranadina.org/)
  <p>With the Neogranadina team I have been working in the development of the Catálogo Colectivo de Archivos Colombianos (CCA). The CCAC is a multirepository of archival descriptions, metadata, and digital objects for Colombian institutions who need support with the preservation and promotion of their historical heritage. We have created the CCCAC using the open source web application [AtoM "Access to Memory"](https://www.accesstomemory.org/) and organized the archival descriptions based on international standards such as [ISAD(G)](https://www.ica.org/es). More on this project [here.](https://neogranadina.org/projects/ccac)</p>


## [Archives Initiative: Neogranadina & UC Santa Barbara - Processing Interface (Project Contributor, 2018- ) ](https://neogranadina.org/procesamiento/0-empieza-aca)
  <p>Educational platform for Neogranadina volunteers who contribute with the processing of digitized volumes. I currently supervise the interaction of the volunteers with this platform.</p>


## [The Conway Collection (Project Creator, 2017)](https://sbgen.org/gallery.php?cid=5&sid=1)
  <p>As an intern at the Santa Barbara County Genealogical Society (SBGCS), I created the image gallery of the Conway Collection. Joel Conway was a local photographer who devoted most of his life to compile antique photographs from Santa Barbara and southern California. I digitized the glass plate negatives, added metadata to the digital objects, and sorted the physical materials according to the SBGCS standards for further preservation.</p>


## [Remembering WWI (Project Contributor, 2016)](https://rememberingwwi.villanova.edu/)
  <p>During my M.A. at Villanova University, I was one of the contributors in a digital project that explored scrapbooks as a form of memory and source of information on varied experiences during the First World War. I created articles exploring a topics related to understanding WWI and a digital project based on the materials contained in the scrapbooks. The project was led by dh specialist Deborah Boyer and in collaboration with the Special Collections division at VU.</p>
