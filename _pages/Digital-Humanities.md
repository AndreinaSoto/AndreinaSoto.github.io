I love working with digital tools since they offer endless opportunities to develop and promote humanistic research. These are the projects I have been involved over the past years.

## [Sacred Spaces. Mapping Religion and the Built Environment in Early-Modern Venezuela. Project Creator, 2019- ](https://andreinasoto.github.io/mapping-venezuela/)
“Sacred Spaces” is a digital project about the history of the Province of Venezuela through the lens of the religious built environment created during the colonial period (1500-1800). My goal is to create visualization tools that show how the territorial expansion of the region depended upon local actors who adapted to the circumstances of the environment and its people. This project is still under development, but you can see version 1.0 on the official website.


## [Catálogo Colectivo de Archivos Colombianos / Collective Catalogue of Colombian Archives. Neogranadina. Project Contributor, 2019- ](https://ccac.neogranadina.org/)
 With the Neogranadina team, I have been working in the development of the Catálogo Colectivo de Archivos Colombianos (CCAC). The CCAC is a multirepository of archival descriptions, metadata, and digital objects for Colombian institutions who need support with the preservation and promotion of their historical heritage. We created the CCCAC using the open source web application AtoM ("Access to Memory") and organized the archival descriptions based on international standards such as ISAD(G). More on this project [here.](https://neogranadina.org/projects/ccac)


## [Archives Initiative: Neogranadina & UC Santa Barbara. Project Contributor, 2018-  ](https://neogranadina.org/procesamiento/0-empieza-aca)
 Neogranadina’s educational platform for volunteers who contribute with the processing of digitized volumes. I currently supervise the progress of our volunteers and their interaction of this platform.

## #Equiano takes SocialMedia. Project Creator, 2017-2018.
Based on Olaudah Equiano's (1745?-1797) autobiography, I have assigned my World history students with the task of bringing Olaudah's story to social media. Students are in charge of creating posts based on the autobiography that reflect ideas about freedom and enslavement, Olaudah's views on the Atlantic world. Students also need convey the reasoning behind their posts and the images they are using. This exercise is intended to engage students with a historical narratives and adapt them to a contemporary audience.
You can follow Oulaudah on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/equiano_o) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/equiano_o/?hl=en).  

## [The Conway Collection. Project Creator, 2017](https://sbgen.org/gallery.php?cid=5&sid=1)
As an intern at the Santa Barbara County Genealogical Society (SBGCS), I created the image gallery of the Conway Collection to promote the holdings of this institutions among historians and genealogists. Joel Conway was a local photographer who devoted most of his life to compile antique photographs from Santa Barbara and southern California. This project consisted in digitizing over nine hundred glass plate negatives from the mid-twentieth century, adding metadata to the digital objects, and sorting the physical materials according to the SBGCS standards for further preservation.

## [Remembering WWI. Project Contributor, 2016](https://rememberingwwi.villanova.edu/)
During my M.A. at Villanova University, I participated in a digital project that explored scrapbooks as a form of memory and source of information on varied experiences during the First World War. I created articles exploring a topics related to understanding WWI and a digital project based on the materials contained in the scrapbooks. The project was led by DH specialist Deborah Boyer and in collaboration with the Special Collections division at VU.
