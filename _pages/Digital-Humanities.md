 I am passionate about making specialized information accessible to broad audiences. Over the past years I have worked with different initiatives implementing digital humanities methods to preserve and promote humanistic knowledge and inquiry. I have acquired practical knowledge in a diverse set of tools for research, online exhibits, databases, workflows, web and content management. Some of these tools include: GitHub, Jekyll, Access to Memory (AtoM), MapBox, Airtable, Omeka S, and WordPress.

**DH Projects**

## [Sacred Spaces. Mapping Religion and the Built Environment in Early-Modern Venezuela. Project Creator, 2019- ](https://andreinasoto.github.io/mapping-venezuela/)

“Sacred Spaces” is a digital project about the history of the Province of Venezuela through the lens of the religious built environment created during the colonial period (1500-1800). My goal is to create visualization tools that show how the territorial expansion of the region depended upon local actors who adapted to the circumstances of the environment and its people. *This project is still under development, but you can see version 1.0 on the official website.*

## [Catálogo Colectivo de Archivos Colombianos / Collective Catalogue of Colombian Archives. Neogranadina. Project Contributor, 2019- ](https://ccac.neogranadina.org/)

The CCAC is a multirepository of archival descriptions, metadata, and digital objects for Colombian institutions who need support with the preservation and promotion of their historical heritage. We created the CCCAC using the open source web application AtoM ("Access to Memory") and organized the archival descriptions based on international standards such as ISAD(G). More on this project [here.](https://neogranadina.org/projects/ccac)

## [Archives Initiative: Neogranadina & UC Santa Barbara. Project Contributor, 2018-  ](https://neogranadina.org/procesamiento/0-empieza-aca)

 Neogranadina’s educational first platform for volunteers who contribute with the processing of digitized volumes. I supervise the progress of our volunteers and their interaction of this platform. *We are currently working on a new version of using Omeka S and Data Scribe.*

## Olaudah Equiano takes Social Media. Project Creator, 2017-2018.

Based on Olaudah Equiano's (1745?-1797) autobiography, I assigned my World history students with the task of bringing Olaudah's story to social media. Students were in charge of creating posts based on the autobiography that reflect ideas about freedom and enslavement in the Atlantic world. Students also needed to think critically their choices, and justify the posts and the images they are using to tell Equiano's story. This exercise was intended to engage students with a historical narratives and adapt them to a contemporary audience.
You can follow Oulaudah on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/equiano_o) and [**instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/equiano_o/?hl=en).  

## [Remembering WWI. Project Contributor, 2016](https://rememberingwwi.villanova.edu/)

During my M.A. at Villanova University, I participated in a digital project that explored scrapbooks as a form of memory and source of information on varied experiences during the First World War. I created articles exploring a topics related to understanding WWI and a digital project about female representations in WWI visual culture. The project was led by DH specialist Deborah Boyer in collaboration with the Special Collections division at VU.
