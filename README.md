# Welcome to your new History 295LA website

I have adapted the [Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog-jekyll/) to help you get to grips with Jekyll and GitHub pages, and to give you a head start developing your personal websites and projects.

# To start:
Open the file called `_config.yml` and enter your details.

# How do I use Markdown?
Check the example blog post, both on the site and in the `_posts` folder.

# How do I add new blog posts?
Create new markdown files in the `_posts` folder, making sure to include the header bit between the three lines (`---`). The easiest way is to create a copy of the example post I made for you and to edit it.

# How do I add new pages?
Create a new markdown file in the main folder, making sure to include the header bit between the three lines (`---`). The easiest way, again, is to create a copy of an existing file, such as `about.md`.

# How do I edit the look and feel of my site (fonts, etc.)?
By editing the `assets/main.scss`. I put instructions inside.

# How do I edit the navigation menu?
By editing the `_includes/navbar.html`. I put instructions inside.

# What if I want the home page to be a static page and not a list of blog posts?
Replace the file called `index.html` with the file called `index(page-first).html` (by removing the bit in parentheses), and you can edit the contents as if it were a normal page using Markdown and HTML as long as you keep the YAML header (the bit between the sets of three dashes - `---`) To change it back, replace that file with `index(blog-first.html)`.

# What happens if I break something?
You can always undo the last thing you did and save the file again. If it all goes horribly wrong, you can make a fresh start by unzipping the theme file again and moving your content across. If you get completely stuck, see me in office hours.

The original readme.md that came with the theme can be fund in the file called original-readme.md
